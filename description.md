# Operating_Systems_Training

By completing the tasks, I am able to:

- Strategies for programming at the Operating System level

- Fundamental system calls for process creation, termination

- Fundamental system calls to allocate, change, and deallocate primary memory to processes

- Libraries to handle buffered and unbuffered interconnections with the computer, including files and I/O devices

- The identification of the most suitable algorithms for process, memory, and I/O management depending on the context in which their target operating system is working.
